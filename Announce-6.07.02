Hello,

I am pleased to announce that tcsh-6.07 is finally available; this is
a bug fix maintenance release with only two new features:

	- GNU style configure script (ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu)
	- implicit chdir (hutchins@sgi.com & dbg@sgi.com)

Tcsh is an enhanced version of the Berkeley C-shell that offers command
line editing and completion plus many other little things that preserve
the length of your fingers.

Tcsh runs on most unix machines, VMS_POSIX, and it compiles
and is very close to working on OS/2 EMX.

You can get tcsh from ftp.deshaw.edu:/pub/tcsh/tcsh-6.07.tar.gz
This is a gzip (GNU zip) tar archive. If you don't have GNU zip you
can get it from prep.ai.mit.edu or other GNU mirrors, or ask ftp to
unpack it on the fly using 'get tcsh-6.07.tar'.

I would like to thank:

    o D. E. Shaw & Co. for providing a home for tcsh
    o everyone who sent bug reports
    o the beta team for all their help, bug fixes, and suggestions

christos
