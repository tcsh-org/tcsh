# This script converts a tcsh nls file into a format suitable for compiling
# with RC and stubdll.c. This gives us a stringtable resource in the DLL 
# which  can be loaded at startup for tcsh messages.
#
# Depending on the languages, the final output may take some tweaking. I have
# not been able to get Greek to compile in the resource compiler. French,
# German, and the C locale seem to work.
#
# This prints to stdout, so redirect to appropriate place.
#
# The algorithm is simple :
#
# String ID = set number * 10,000 + message number
#
# This is because we cannot have two messages with the same id.
