65. Added case insensitive globbing for OS/2
64. FIOCLEX and FIONCLEX are only used if we don't have FD_CLOEXEC.
63. Added emx termio support, and emx pathsep support; emx compiles and runs:

    the input stream... Useful for status (^T)
53. $? == $status and $# == $#argv like in the bourne shell.
52. Added $dirstack. Problems: off by one since =0 == $cwd, but 
    $dirstack[1] == $cwd... Suggestions welcome.
51. Leading spaces would confuse the run-help function.

42. Fixed bug with the new margin code (thanks justin)
41. Fixed mirroring of variables. Now set and setenv affect

    environment variables.
40. Fixed gcc-2.0 warnings in sh.sem.c (needed for vfork() -O2 optimization)
39. 6.01.05 (2/21/92)
38. signal masking for BSD machines was still wrong in tw.init.c
37. Added $margin_bug, and now the editor outputs on the rightmost 
    column by default. This should fix the xterm cut-n-paste problem.
36. AU/X 2.0 and SGI compiles with POSIX as a default now.
35. sysv_echo is gone too. Now we have a variable called echo_style
    which can be set to "none", "bsd", "sysv", "both" that defines
    the builtin echo_style. The default is "bsd" for systems with
    SYSVREL == 0, "sysv" otherwise. This can be overriden in config.h
    by defining ECHO_STYLE ro be BSD_ECHO, SYSV_ECHO, BOTH_ECHO, 
    or NONE_ECHO.
34. asynchronous notification in run-fg-editor would try to change the 
    tty settings and print an extra prompt.
    > set notify 
    > sleep 10 &
    > vi^Z
    > ^[^Z
33. alias x /bin/true
    x<esc>?

24. `` were not working correctly when tcsh is started with 0,1,2 closed.
23. Correction was picking up the wrong thing in cases like .rhosts hosts

    <sys/wait.h> in some os's.
10. Setting savehist to an empty string makes savehist use the value
    in $history.
9.  echotc did not use the internal termcap descriptions.
8.  echotc did not work right for single argument termcap strings.
7.  DGUX needs SAVESIGVEC, updated type protection, and disabled CSWTCH.
6.  Changed SVID to SYSVREL, since there is no SVID == 4 (yet).
5.  Typo in tc.sig.h: UNRELSIGS was not getting defined.
4.  Globbing bug fix. tglob() should ignore globbing characters inside 
    backquotes otherwise things get expanded twice:
    % echo 'bar?' > 'foo?'
    % echo `cat foo\?`
    echo: No match.
3.  Mach setpath fix.
2.  Alliant process group fix.
1.  Xenix fixes for broken vi and help path with no suffixes.

14. Mach does not need setenv in lib; in fact that does not work right.
13. shell level gets decremented when we exec.

    (The _ctype_ was getting indexed with shorts...)
 0. Complete overhaul. Brought in the 4.4 csh stuff. Separated most
    tcsh and csh code except where I would have to add more global
    variables. Compiled correctly with both lint and gcc -Wall on
    a sparc running 4.1

V5.20.03, 03/20/91.	- Never released
25. Kanji, SXA additions.
24. (exec foo) should not fail if they are suspended jobs.
23. Support kernel paging stuff on aix 370.
22. Now we handle correctly the environment variables LINES, COLUMNS,
    TERMCAP for window size changes...
21. Tcsh 5.18c+ had broken NULL chars on scripts.
    > cat > foo 
    #!/usr/local/bin/tcsh -f
    echo "foo"
    echo "^V^@"
    echo "bar"
    ^D
    > chmod +x foo; foo
    foo
20. Posix has EAGAIN and not EWOULDBLOCK
19. Don't set ECHOK; makes kill ^U ugly.
18. $shell is SHELLPATH and not $SHELL any more.
17. Added -n flag to cd, pushd, popd and dirs. Documented -l and -v
    flags.
16. Documented and fixed chase_symlinks and ignore_symlinks.
15. Call endpwent() when you get interrupted...
    cd ~chri<tab>^C
    cd ~christos/<enter>
    <stuck>
14. Exec when you have suspended jobs asks for verification.
13. Variable length fixes:
    >set abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz=1
    >echo $abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    abcdefghijklmnopqrs: Undefined variable
    Now we have better messages too...
12. Icon fixes...
11. Quote expanded glob and history chars too.
10. If someone sets SHIN to O_NDELAY we died... Now we set it back...
 9. unset path; unsetenv PATH; ls-F; (poof) fixed...
 8. Patches for masscomp, and ${var123} lexical analysis fix...
 7. Patch for sunview bug: A partially covered suntool sends SIGWINCH every
    time the text is scrolled, causing annoying redraw effects. Now tcsh
    checks if the size really changed before doing anything.
 6. Interrupt in the middle of cwdcmd, and periodic does not remove the
    aliases.
 5. prompt2 and prompt3 fixes:
    Prompt2 now prints the status of the parser by default.
    Prompt3 can now have the standard prompt escape sequences.
 4. eval file descriptor re-direction fix.
    >set p='w | tail +3'
    >eval $p
    (originally | tail +3 was ignored)
 3. $edit != emacs anymore; it was misleading, 'set edit' enables editing
    'unset edit' disables it.
 2. PERROR define fix. 
 1. irix3.3.1 line discipline fix.

V5.20.02, 12/15/90.
32. /etc/Logout added and merged with /etc/Login flag.
31. Fixed tty chars in ed.init.c. Some of them were not handled correctly.
30. Command execution does not leak memory any more, and doing
    ~ four times does not core-dump.
29. Fixed the notorious csh 'if(' bug (part of the convex fixes)
28. Intelligent getwd() on startup, and canonicalization.
27. Intelligent directory stack. Gets updated when $HOME changes.
26. Directory stack/save-restore additions
25. Convex Fixes.
24. Fixed onlret, and echonl getting stuck on svid.
23. Shouldn't leave tty in raw mode at auto-logout (e.g. when su'ing from a
    csh, this is annoying).
22. Some users had environment EMACS set to something, and with my bad fix
    at pl 1 found that they didn't have echo... (of course, even before my
    "fix", they didn't have editing...). Anyway, refined the check to be
    for EMACS=t, which is what emacs sets when running a subshell.
21. kill -CONT %job, would not update the status of the job, but it would
    just restart it.
20. Sequent fixes.
19. AIX370 signal and TCF fixes.
18. fixed ls-F -l, SIGINT problem.
17. aix on the ps2 does not have strcoll() either.
16. Bind [A - [D and OA to OD in vi mode to the arrow key functions
    so that they work from insert mode.
15. %~ was not working correctly for /home/news and /home/newsbin...
14. Removed Rcs Log
13. ISC unix fixes.
12. sunos3.x wants <sys/dir.h> not <dirent.h>
11. Remove precmd's, cwdcmd's and periodic cmds that had errors.
10. Compile sunos4.1 using termio. 
 9. Rs6000 line discipline fixes. 
 8. T_Tabs was wrong for termio machines.
 7. Don't bind single keystroke arrow keys, when they are already bound!
 6. Test for newline and tab before deciding not to send shell scripts
    to the bourne shell.
 5. Added LITERAL prompt stuff.
 4. Fixed gethostname() in sh.rest.c to return the nodename.
 3. Do not quote spell checked stuff. This is not very intelligent but
    works better than before.
 2. Fixes for relative path components. (paths that start with a .)
 1. Fixed so that Rawmode() is not called when we are not editing
    (breaks running under emacs)

V5.20.01, 11/15/90.
12. Recognize environment variables too.
11. Always start in Rawmode()
10. don't try to execute binary files using the bourne shell.
 9. Vi change to end of line updates correctly now.
 8. Prompt in continuation lines.
 7. Prompt in if statements fix.
 6. System V ^C works right now.
 5. ^Z works correctly in bindings
 4. Better error messages for variables.
 3. dinit() now is more robust.
 2. Added aux2.0 patches.
 1. Fixed bug with arrow key bindings in ed.screen.c. All the keys
    were bound to up-history!

V5.20.00, 11/10/90.
26. Fixed system V and POSIX time reporting.
25. Fixed ed.screen.c so that it does not use malloc().
24. Fixed SIGWINCH on the iris
23. Fixed ed.screen.c, so that settc works correcly. It used to set
    the termcap with a string that was allocated from the stack!
22. Fixed listing of commands, where the last command was not checked.
21. Fixed which command. It did not work for
    \<command>, if command was aliased.
20. Eliminated CSH4.3 define. You've had enough time to upgrade from 4.2
19. Fixed GotTermCaps to be called only once.
18. Added bindkey -r
17. Attributes were not getting reset correctly.
16. history -t does not print the time-stamp.
15. AddXkey, works now for single character xkeys.
14. filetype() knows better about symlinks.
13. ls-F works with filenames that have metachars
12. Completion/spelling works with quoted things.
11. Fixed refresh bug. Repeat by:
    On an intelligent terminal that has insert and delete chars (xterm)
    > orphan
    > vi orphan.c
    > ^P^P
10. Fixed so that if we don't have a tty on stdin editing is disabled.
 9. Check for nested process forking, to avoid loops such as:
    > alias foo 'set bar=`foo`'
    > foo
 8. Fix setting of AsciiOnly (Per)
 7. tw.spell.c, defined F_OK for systems that don't have it.
 6. ourwait.h had typo in ifdef.
 5. BSD compilers need a cast to int for enums used in 
    switches (Matthew Day)
 4. Found the cause for the core-dump in long backquote 
    expansions (Mark Davies)
 3. Some externs in ed.h needed to be truly externs...
    reported by Mark Davies, bug appeared only on hp9000s800.
 2. Changed $tcsh, and $version strings.
 1. Added internal sprintf function, renamed putchar to CSHputchar,
    printf to CSHprintf, sprintf to CSHsprintf.

V5.19.02, 10/23/90.
36. Added /etc/cshrc for the SGI irises.
35. Added expand-variables function.
34. Documented $time in tcsh.man
33. Shell variables are now 'recognized' when expanding/listing things.
32. ls-F does not eat the last slash on the / directory!
31. Strings bound to keys are printed inside double quotes.
30. History now remembers the exact line, not just an unparsed version of
    the tokens.
29. Renamed itoa to Itoa(), so things in libc that use itoa() don't break.
28. Ported to IBM aix/ps2. 
27. Fixed eval so that it forks when the output is piped
    Repeat by:
    > who | grep $user
    > eval who | grep $user
26. Fixed so that 'nice <builtin changing the working directory>' does not
    nice or fork.
    Consider doing:
    nice cd /tmp && rm *.c (don't try it!!!)
    [what actually happens is that nice has to fork, then the child executes
     chdir, and the parent stays where it was]
25. Added Dan's patches (nls, builtin bindkey, fixes to the editor).
24. Added aix370, migrate, getspath, getspath, getxvers, setxvers
23. Added builtin echotc, removed sl and el.
22. Ported to 4.4 BSD. This involved changing the way lots of flags worked,
    cleanup of the SVID stuff, and addition of more compilation flags.
    Now POSIX can work whed BSD is defined...
21. Fixed so that el, sl work. Actually they are to be removed soon and
    be replaced with echotc.
20. Avoid the Quoted Space hack for alias when printing jobs!
    [aliases to the same name avoid further alias expansion, by 
     inserting a quoted space in front of the command. In SHORT_STRINGS
     QUOTE is the 15th bit so print ignores it thinking it is the
     end of the string. So we just skip the Quoted Space....]
    Repeat by:
    > set notify
    > alias ls ls -F
    > (ls) &
    Prints        Exit 0 (
    Should print: Exit 0 ( ls -F )
19. Fixed so that "", '', ``, all produce ': Command not found',
    and not the spurious messages.
    Repeat by:
    > set path = (/bin /usr/bin .... .)
    > ""
    /some/path/name/: Command not found
18. Enable the use of <ctype.h> macros if they exist and NLS is defined.
    NLS code is not ready yet.
17. Fixed rmstar and continue_jobs code, so that they are not compile
    options, but shell variables. Now you need to 'set rmstar' to get
    enable rmstar.
16. Fixed SIGWINCH, SIGWINDOW, and setting of li, co, that broke
    suntools, and others.
    Repeat by:
    Start a shelltool of size other than 80x34
    > telltc
    > stty -a
    do not report the same number of lines and columns.
15. More fixes to tw.parse.c, and tw.spell.c.
14. More fixes to sh.char.c.
13. Fixed coredump caused by ``.
12. Fixed spell-line code..
11. Trapped SIGCHLD in sh.sem.c, while forking. Still there is a small
    race, but the probability of happening is smaller!
10. Fixed sh.char.c to be ISO compliant.
 9. Added expand-glob
 8. Fixed ourwait.h for little endians.
 7. Fixed that foreach i (^D expands correctly.
 6. Fixed so that listmax is ignored in ls-F.
 5. Fixed spelling correction so that single letter words and words that
    contain globbing chars do not get spell checked.
 4. Changed NeXT HOSTTYPE to next, since all HOSTTYPE's are lower case.
 3. Fixed symmetry, and changed symmetry HOSTTYPE from sequent to symmetry.
 2. Added boldfacing, underlining chars.
 1. Added IRIX3.3.1 support.

V5.19.01, 9/26/90.
7. Brought the README file up-to-date, and changed the bug report
   address to point to me.
6. sh.lex.c. In addla(), overflow computation was wrong.
5. Fixed SHELLPATH, to be set correctly when $SHELL is not set.
4. Fixed print statement in sh.proc.c that contained \215.
3. Fixed the Makefile and MAKEDIFFS so that a tahoe diff can be made.
2. RS6000: hacked around execv bug, and ed.init.c warning.
1. Editor should not be enabled when we don't have a tty.
